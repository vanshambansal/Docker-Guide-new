# Docker Images

Think of Docker images like **recipe cards** üìã - they contain all the instructions and ingredients needed to create something delicious (in this case, a running application)!

## What Exactly Is a Docker Image?

A Docker image is like a **frozen pizza** üçï:

- It's **pre-made** with all ingredients included
- It's **packaged** and ready to use
- You can **store many** in your freezer
- When you want pizza, you **cook it** (run it as a container)
- The original frozen pizza stays unchanged - you can make many pizzas from it!

!!! info "Key Point"
    **Images are templates** - they don't do anything by themselves. You need to **run** them to create containers that actually work!

## How Images Work

```
Image (Recipe) ‚Üí docker run ‚Üí Container (Actual Running App)
```

**Example:**
- `nginx` image = Instructions for building a web server
- `nginx` container = An actual web server running and serving websites

## Where Do Images Come From?

### 1. Docker Hub (The App Store for Docker)

**Docker Hub** is like Google Play Store, but for Docker images. It has thousands of ready-made images:

- **nginx** - Web server
- **mysql** - Database
- **python** - Python programming environment
- **wordpress** - Website builder
- **redis** - Fast database for caching

Visit [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) to browse!

### 2. You Build Them Yourself

Later, you'll learn to create your own images using **Dockerfiles** (like writing your own recipe).

### 3. Private Registries

Companies often store their private images in secure registries.

## Working with Images

### See What Images You Have

```bash
docker images
```

**Example output:**
```
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
nginx        latest    a6bd71f48f68   2 weeks ago    187MB
hello-world  latest    d2c94e258dcb   10 months ago  13.3kB
python       3.9       1b33c72fae8d   1 month ago    915MB
```

**What each column means:**
- **REPOSITORY** - The image name (like `nginx`)
- **TAG** - The version (like `latest`, `3.9`, `v1.2`)
- **IMAGE ID** - Unique identifier for this image
- **CREATED** - When this image was built
- **SIZE** - How much space it takes

### Download an Image (Without Running It)

```bash
docker pull nginx
```

This downloads the nginx image but doesn't run it yet. It's like buying a frozen pizza but not cooking it.

### Download a Specific Version

```bash
docker pull python:3.9
```

The `:3.9` part is called a **tag** - it specifies which version you want.

!!! tip "Image Tags Explained"
    - `nginx:latest` = The newest version (default)
    - `python:3.9` = Python version 3.9 specifically
    - `mysql:8.0` = MySQL version 8.0
    - If you don't specify a tag, Docker assumes `:latest`

### Remove an Image

```bash
docker rmi nginx
```

Or using the image ID:
```bash
docker rmi a6bd71f48f68
```

!!! warning "Can't remove images being used"
    If any containers are using an image, you can't remove it. Stop and remove those containers first!

## Let's Practice with Real Examples

### Example 1: Running Different Web Servers

**Try Apache web server:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name apache-server httpd
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` - you'll see "It works!" page.

**Try nginx web server:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 8081:80 --name nginx-server nginx
```

Visit `http://localhost:8081` - you'll see nginx welcome page.

**Now you have TWO web servers running from different images!**

### Example 2: Running a Database

```bash
docker run -d --name my-database -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword mysql
```

**What's happening:**
- `mysql` image contains a complete MySQL database
- `-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword` sets up the database password
- The database is now running in the background!

### Example 3: Interactive Python Environment

```bash
docker run -it python:3.9
```

**What's happening:**
- `-it` means "interactive terminal"
- You get a Python prompt inside the container
- Type `exit()` to leave

## Understanding Image Names and Tags

### Full Image Name Format

```
registry/username/repository:tag
```

**Examples:**
- `nginx:latest` = `docker.io/library/nginx:latest` (full name)
- `mysql:8.0` = Official MySQL version 8.0
- `node:16-alpine` = Node.js version 16 on Alpine Linux (smaller size)

### Common Tags You'll See

- **latest** - The newest stable version
- **alpine** - Smaller, lightweight version (based on Alpine Linux)
- **slim** - Smaller version with fewer features
- **Version numbers** - `3.9`, `8.0`, `v1.2.3` (specific versions)

!!! tip "Pro Tip: Avoid 'latest' in production"
    For real projects, always use specific version tags like `nginx:1.21` instead of `nginx:latest`. This prevents surprises when newer versions come out!

## Image Management Commands

### See Detailed Information About an Image

```bash
docker inspect nginx
```

This shows you **everything** about the image - like reading the nutrition label on food!

### Search for Images on Docker Hub

```bash
docker search python
```

### See Image History (How It Was Built)

```bash
docker history nginx
```

Shows all the layers that make up the image.

### Clean Up Unused Images

```bash
# Remove unused images
docker image prune

# Remove ALL unused images (be careful!)
docker image prune -a
```

## Hands-On Practice Exercise

Let's put it all together! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download Multiple Images

```bash
docker pull nginx
docker pull python:3.9
docker pull redis
```

### Step 2: Check What You Downloaded

```bash
docker images
```

You should see all three images listed.

### Step 3: Run Containers from Each Image

```bash
# Web server
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name web nginx

# Python environment (interactive)
docker run -it --name python-env python:3.9

# (Type exit() to leave Python, then continue)

# Redis database
docker run -d --name cache redis
```

### Step 4: See Everything Running

```bash
docker ps
```

### Step 5: Clean Up

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker stop web python-env cache

# Remove all containers
docker rm web python-env cache

# Remove images if you want
docker rmi nginx python:3.9 redis
```

## Common Mistakes Beginners Make

### Mistake 1: Confusing Images and Containers

‚ùå **Wrong thinking:** "I deleted the nginx container, now nginx is gone"  
‚úÖ **Correct:** The nginx image is still there, you can create new containers anytime

### Mistake 2: Using 'latest' Tag Everywhere

‚ùå **Risky:** `docker run mysql` (gets whatever version is "latest")  
‚úÖ **Better:** `docker run mysql:8.0` (gets specific version you tested)

### Mistake 3: Not Understanding Layers

Images are built in **layers** like a cake:
- Base layer (operating system)
- App layer (your application)
- Config layer (settings)

This makes images efficient - multiple images can share the same base layers!

## Quick Reference

| **Task** | **Command** | **Example** |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| List images | `docker images` | - |
| Download image | `docker pull <image>` | `docker pull nginx` |
| Download specific version | `docker pull <image>:<tag>` | `docker pull python:3.9` |
| Remove image | `docker rmi <image>` | `docker rmi nginx` |
| Search images | `docker search <term>` | `docker search python` |
| Image details | `docker inspect <image>` | `docker inspect nginx` |
| Image history | `docker history <image>` | `docker history nginx` |
| Clean unused images | `docker image prune` | - |

## Key Takeaways

üéØ **Images are blueprints** - they contain everything needed to run an application

üéØ **Containers are instances** - running copies created from images

üéØ **One image, many containers** - you can run multiple containers from the same image

üéØ **Images have versions** - use specific tags for predictable results

üéØ **Docker Hub is your friend** - thousands of pre-built images available

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now understand Docker images - the building blocks of everything in Docker. You've learned how to find, download, run, and manage images. 

Think of images as your **toolkit** - once you understand how to use them, you can run almost any application without worrying about installation headaches!

## The Perfect Analogy: Images as App Installers

**The best way to understand Docker images:**

=== "Real World Comparison"

    **Docker Image = Software Installer**
    
    - **Traditional installer** (like Chrome.exe) contains everything needed to install Chrome
    - **Docker image** contains everything needed to run an application
    - **Installer** sits on your hard drive until you run it
    - **Image** sits in Docker until you create a container from it
    
    **Key insight:** Just like you can install Chrome on multiple computers from one installer, you can create multiple containers from one image!

=== "Kitchen Analogy"

    **Docker Image = Recipe + Ingredients**
    
    - **Recipe** tells you exactly what to do
    - **Ingredients** are all included and pre-measured
    - **Multiple chefs** can cook the same dish from one recipe
    - **Each dish** (container) is separate but made from the same recipe (image)
    
    **Key insight:** The recipe doesn't change, but you can cook many meals from it!

=== "Photography Analogy"

    **Docker Image = Photo Negative**
    
    - **Negative** contains all the information for the photo
    - **Multiple prints** can be made from one negative
    - **Each print** is identical but separate
    - **Negative** stays unchanged no matter how many prints you make
    
    **Key insight:** One image, many identical containers!

---

## What Makes Images So Special?

### üéØ **Everything Included**
Images contain **everything** needed to run an application:
- Operating system files
- Application code
- Runtime (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)
- Libraries and dependencies
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Default commands

### üöÄ **Portable and Consistent**
- **Works everywhere:** Same image runs identically on your laptop, server, or cloud
- **No surprises:** No more "it works on my machine" problems
- **Version controlled:** Each image has a specific version (tag)

### ‚ö° **Layered and Efficient**
- **Smart storage:** Images are built in layers that can be shared
- **Fast downloads:** Only download layers you don't already have
- **Space efficient:** Multiple images can share common layers

---

## Understanding Image Layers

**This is where Docker gets really clever!**

### üç∞ **Images are Like Cakes**

Think of a Docker image as a **layered cake**:

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê  ‚Üê Your App (Layer 4)
‚îÇ     Your Application        ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§  ‚Üê Dependencies (Layer 3)  
‚îÇ    Python Libraries         ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§  ‚Üê Runtime (Layer 2)
‚îÇ      Python 3.9             ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§  ‚Üê Base OS (Layer 1)
‚îÇ    Ubuntu 22.04             ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### üí° **Why Layers Matter**

**Efficiency:** If you have 5 different Python apps, they all share the Ubuntu and Python layers!

**Speed:** When updating your app, Docker only downloads the changed layers.

**Storage:** Instead of 5 complete copies, you have shared base layers + 5 small app layers.

### üëÄ **See Layers in Action**

Let's examine a real image:

```bash
docker history python:3.9-slim
```

**Expected output:**
```
IMAGE          CREATED        CREATED BY                                      SIZE
a3d4fb5c46b8   2 weeks ago    /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD ["python3"]             0B
<missing>      2 weeks ago    /bin/sh -c set -eux;  wget -O get-pip.py...    6.45MB
<missing>      2 weeks ago    /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ENV PYTHON_GET_PIP_URL...   0B
<missing>      3 weeks ago    /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ENV PYTHON_PIP_VERSION...   0B
<missing>      3 weeks ago    /bin/sh -c cd /usr/local/bin  && ln -s idl...  32B
```

**What you're seeing:**
- Each line is a layer
- Layers with 0B size are just metadata changes
- Larger layers contain actual files and installations

---

## Working with Docker Hub

**Docker Hub is like the App Store for Docker images!**

### üåê **Finding Images**

**Option 1: Browse Docker Hub website**
1. Go to [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)
2. Search for what you need (e.g., "nginx", "python", "mysql")
3. Look for **Official Images** (they have a checkmark)

**Option 2: Search from command line**
```bash
docker search python
```

**Expected output:**
```
NAME                     DESCRIPTION                                     STARS    OFFICIAL
python                   Python is an interpreted, interactive...       8072     [OK]
pypy                     PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative...       355      [OK]
python/python-dev        Python development image                       12       
```

### üì• **Downloading Images**

**Pull an image:**
```bash
docker pull python:3.9
```

**What happens:**
```
3.9: Pulling from library/python
a2abf6c4d29d: Pull complete
c7288b2b92d5: Pull complete
67c6d5e8e5bc: Pull complete
e9c5a4b7e5c7: Pull complete
```

**See what you downloaded:**
```bash
docker images
```

**Expected output:**
```
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
python        3.9       a3d4fb5c46b8   2 weeks ago    885MB
```

### üè∑Ô∏è **Understanding Tags**

**Tags are like version numbers:**

```bash
# Specific version
docker pull python:3.9.16

# Major version (gets latest 3.9.x)
docker pull python:3.9

# Latest stable release
docker pull python:latest

# Minimal version (smaller size)
docker pull python:3.9-slim
```

**Pro tip:** Always use specific tags in production!

---

## Essential Image Commands

### üìã **List Your Images**
```bash
docker images
```
**or**
```bash
docker image ls
```

**Expected output:**
```
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
nginx         latest    605c77e624dd   3 weeks ago    141MB
python        3.9       a3d4fb5c46b8   2 weeks ago    885MB
ubuntu        22.04     ba6acccedd29   4 weeks ago    72.8MB
```

### üîç **Inspect an Image**
```bash
docker inspect python:3.9
```

**This shows you everything:**
- Environment variables
- Default command
- Working directory
- Ports exposed
- Layer information

**For human-readable format:**
```bash
docker inspect python:3.9 | grep -A 10 "Config"
```

### üìä **Check Image Details**
```bash
docker image inspect python:3.9 --format='{{.Size}}'
```

**See layer history:**
```bash
docker history python:3.9
```

### üè∑Ô∏è **Tag Images**
```bash
# Create a new tag for existing image
docker tag python:3.9 my-python:latest

# Tag with your registry name
docker tag python:3.9 myregistry.com/python:3.9
```

### üóëÔ∏è **Remove Images**
```bash
# Remove specific image
docker rmi python:3.9

# Remove by image ID
docker rmi a3d4fb5c46b8

# Remove multiple images
docker rmi python:3.9 nginx:latest

# Remove all unused images
docker image prune
```

---

## Hands-On Practice

### üß™ **Exercise 1: Explore Popular Images**

**Let's examine different types of images:**

```bash
# Download different image types
docker pull hello-world
docker pull nginx:alpine
docker pull python:3.9-slim
docker pull ubuntu:22.04
```

**Compare their sizes:**
```bash
docker images
```

**Question for you:** Why is `hello-world` so tiny but `python:3.9-slim` so large?

??? note "Answer"
    - `hello-world` only contains a simple program that prints a message
    - `python:3.9-slim` contains a full Python runtime, libraries, and OS components
    - `alpine` versions are smaller because they use Alpine Linux (minimal OS)
    - Size reflects what's included in the image

### üß™ **Exercise 2: Image Investigation**

**Pick an image and become an expert on it:**

```bash
# Let's investigate nginx
docker pull nginx:latest

# See the layers
docker history nginx:latest

# See detailed configuration
docker inspect nginx:latest

# Look for key information
docker inspect nginx:latest --format='{{.Config.ExposedPorts}}'
docker inspect nginx:latest --format='{{.Config.Env}}'
```

**Challenge:** Can you figure out:
- What port does nginx expose?
- What's the default command when nginx starts?
- What environment variables are set?

### üß™ **Exercise 3: Image Management**

**Practice keeping your system clean:**

```bash
# See current images
docker images

# Tag an image with your name
docker tag nginx:latest my-nginx:v1

# See the new tag
docker images

# Remove the original tag
docker rmi nginx:latest

# Clean up unused images
docker image prune
```

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### üö® **"No space left on device"**

**Problem:** Docker images filling up your disk

**Solutions:**
```bash
# See disk usage
docker system df

# Clean up unused images
docker image prune

# Clean up everything unused (careful!)
docker system prune -a

# Remove specific large images
docker rmi large-image:tag
```

### üö® **"Pull access denied" or "Not found"**

**Problem:** Can't download an image

**Common causes and fixes:**
```bash
# Check spelling and case
docker pull nginx    # ‚úÖ Correct
docker pull NGINX    # ‚ùå Wrong case

# Check if image exists
docker search python-nodejs    # Might not exist

# Use official images when possible
docker pull python             # ‚úÖ Official
docker pull python-official    # ‚ùå Not official
```

### üö® **"Image not found locally"**

**Problem:** Trying to use an image you haven't pulled

**Solution:**
```bash
# This fails if image isn't local
docker run my-custom-image

# Pull first, then run
docker pull my-custom-image
docker run my-custom-image
```

### üö® **"Multiple tags for same image ID"**

**Problem:** Confused by same image having multiple tags

**Understanding:** This is normal! Example:
```bash
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       SIZE
python        3.9       a3d4fb5c46b8   885MB
python        latest    a3d4fb5c46b8   885MB
my-python     v1        a3d4fb5c46b8   885MB
```

All three tags point to the **same image**. Removing one tag doesn't delete the image until all tags are removed.

---

## Image Best Practices

### ‚úÖ **Do This**

**Use specific tags:**
```bash
# Good - specific and predictable
docker pull python:3.9.16-slim

# Avoid - could change over time
docker pull python:latest
```

**Keep images updated:**
```bash
# Regularly update base images
docker pull python:3.9
docker pull nginx:alpine
```

**Clean up regularly:**
```bash
# Weekly cleanup routine
docker image prune
```

### ‚ùå **Avoid This**

**Don't use `latest` in production:**
- `latest` can change without notice
- Makes deployments unpredictable
- Hard to rollback issues

**Don't accumulate unused images:**
- They consume disk space
- Can slow down Docker operations
- Make image listing confusing

---

## Mental Model Check

**Before moving on, make sure you understand:**

### üß† **Key Concepts**
- [ ] **Images vs Containers:** Images are templates, containers are running instances
- [ ] **Layers:** Images are built in layers that can be shared and cached
- [ ] **Tags:** Ways to version and identify images
- [ ] **Registries:** Where images are stored and shared (Docker Hub, etc.)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Skills**
- [ ] **Find images** on Docker Hub or via search
- [ ] **Pull images** to your local machine
- [ ] **Inspect images** to understand their contents
- [ ] **Manage images** (list, tag, remove, clean up)
- [ ] **Understand image information** (size, layers, configuration)

### üéØ **Test Yourself**

**Quick quiz:**
1. If you delete an image, what happens to containers made from it?
2. Why might two different image names show the same Image ID?
3. What's the difference between `python:3.9` and `python:3.9-slim`?

??? note "Answers"
    1. **Nothing!** Containers are independent copies. The running container continues, but you can't create new ones from the deleted image.
    2. **Same content, different tags** - like having multiple names for the same person.
    3. **Size and contents** - `slim` versions have fewer packages installed, making them smaller but potentially missing some libraries.
