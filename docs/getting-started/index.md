# Getting Started with Docker 

Welcome to your Docker journey! This section will take you from **never hearing about Docker** to **running your first containers** with confidence.

## What You'll Accomplish Here

By the end of this section, you'll:

- ✅ Have Docker installed and working on your computer
- ✅ Understand what Docker actually is (in simple terms)
- ✅ Run your first container and see it work
- ✅ Know the basic Docker commands you'll use every day
- ✅ Feel confident to move to more advanced topics

!!! tip "Time Investment"
    **Total time:** 2-3 hours at a comfortable pace
    
    **Can't do it all at once?** Each page builds on the previous one, so you can stop and come back anytime!

---

## Your Learning Path

Follow these pages **in order** for the best experience:

### 1. 📥 [Installation](installation.md)
**What:** Get Docker installed on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

**Why:** You need Docker running before you can do anything else!

**Time:** 20-30 minutes

!!! info "Before you start"
    Make sure your computer meets the basic requirements (we'll check this together).

---

### 2. 👋 [First Steps](first-steps.md)  
**What:** Run your very first Docker container and understand what just happened

**Why:** There's nothing like seeing Docker work to understand what the fuss is about!

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

**You'll run commands like:**
```bash
docker run hello-world
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

---

### 3. 🐳 [Docker Basics](basics.md)
**What:** Learn the core concepts - images, containers, and essential commands

**Why:** These fundamentals will make everything else make sense

**Time:** 45-60 minutes

**Key concepts you'll master:**
- What's the difference between an image and a container?
- How to start, stop, and manage containers
- Basic Docker commands you'll use daily

---

## Quick Confidence Booster

**Feeling overwhelmed?** Don't worry! Here's what makes this different from other Docker tutorials:

### 🎯 **Beginner-First Approach**
- We assume **zero** prior knowledge
- Every technical term is explained in simple language
- Real-world analogies help concepts stick

### 🛠 **Hands-On Learning**
- Every command includes the **expected output**
- Screenshots for important steps
- "What if this goes wrong?" sections

### ✨ **Progressive Difficulty**
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Each page builds naturally on the previous one
- Clear checkpoints so you know you're on track

=== "Quick Explorer"

    **Perfect for you if:** You want to see results fast and learn by doing
    
    **Approach:**
    - Skip to [First Steps](first-steps.md) after installing
    - Come back to [Docker Basics](basics.md) when you want deeper understanding
    - Jump around based on what interests you
    
    **Time:** 1-2 hours (basic working knowledge)

=== "Reference User"

    **Perfect for you if:** You have some experience and want specific information
    
    **Approach:**
    - Use the [Command Reference](../reference/commands.md) as needed
    - Focus on gaps in your knowledge
    - Skip what you already know
    
    **Time:** 30-60 minutes (filling knowledge gaps)

## What If You Get Stuck?

**Don't panic!** Getting stuck is part of learning. Here's your support system:

### 🆘 **Immediate Help:**
1. **Read the error message carefully** - they're usually helpful
2. **Check our [Troubleshooting Guide](../practical-guides/troubleshooting.md)**
3. **Try the command again** - sometimes it just needs a retry

### 🤔 **If You're Confused:**
1. **Re-read the previous section** - you might have missed something
2. **Check if Docker is running** - this fixes 80% of issues
3. **Look up terms** in our [Glossary](../reference/glossary.md)

### 💡 **If Something Doesn't Work:**
1. **Check the exact command** - typos are common
2. **Verify your system** - Windows/Mac/Linux differences
3. **Try a simpler version first** - break it down into steps
